# WTF
Local First software involves a hard set of problems that I failed to solve at Blackthorn. I need to understand the problem and how build solutions for it.

## The Problem
CRDTs are unintuitive and hard to get right. In order to better understand CRDTs, I need to understand time keeping in concurrency. Time keeping in distributed systems stretches my brain like thinking in callbacks or learning to write shaders. I need fundamentals and practice to build insight.

## The Solution
This repo is a playground for me to build distributed clocks and learn how this building block works.
